This is a program in C that demonstrates a simple shell terminal in Linux OS.
This shell allows the user to make different system calls using the terminal like the real terminal.
In order to terminate the program enter the "done" call, this will close everything but before doing so,
it will print some details about the last run, like how many commands were executed.
ls, ls -l, man, cat...
Note: cd is un-supported (currently).
