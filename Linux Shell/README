This is a program that stimulates how the Operation-System manages and stores the different 
files and their data, their names and anything associated to them.
This program follows the way that the unix-file-system uses to store the files and data on the disk.
In this final excrecise, we are requested to stimulate the Disk File System of a small computer
with two very known methods: 
                            A) Direct Blocks.
                            B) Single In-Direct Block.
The Disk-File-System uses the different blocks of the disk to store information in a 
speciefic way, which the normal user would not be able to navigate in, therefore
this program is created to organize the data on the disk and simplify if for the user, who
will request to read from a single file and not the whole blocks of the disk.
There are 9 functions for the user in this program:
1)listAll -> This function will print the disk's content, alongside the OpenFileDescriptors vector in a table format,
giving the user information of the current status of the different files on the system.
2)fsFormat -> Format the disk, this function must be called before any operation can be performed
on our disk. This is the initialization of the disk.
3)CreateFile -> Create a new file, after calling the function enter the name you wish to name the file.
4)OpenFile -> This function is used to open closed files, enter the file's name you want to open.
5)CloseFile -> This function is used to close opened files, enter a file's file descriptor to close.
6)WriteToFile -> This function is used to write to a given fd, the user will need to enter the file descriptor
of the file he wants to write to, and then the data to be written to the file.
7)ReadFromFile -> This function is used to read from a given fd, the user will need to enter the file descriptor 
of the file he wants to read from, and then the length of data to be read.
8)DeleteFile -> This function is used to delete files, enter the file's name you want to delete.
0)Exit-> Exit the program and close terminal.
